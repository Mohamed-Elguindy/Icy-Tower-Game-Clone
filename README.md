# Icy-Tower-Game-Clone
Technologies: C++, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Simple Graphics Library (SGL v1.0br)
Developed a 2D vertical-scrolling platformer inspired by ICY Tower using C++. Implemented key mechanics such as gravity, jumping, platform generation, collision detection, and score tracking. Utilized Simple Graphics Library (SGL v1.0br, 32-bit) for graphics rendering. Applied OOP principles to structure game components for modularity and maintainability.
